# Shoe-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-CNN-
This CNN project aims to classify shoe images into three categories: Boots, Sandals, and Slippers. Using a dataset from an e-commerce site, the model is trained on a labeled training set and tested on a mixed-category test set. Performance is evaluated based on accuracy to improve product classification and user experience.
